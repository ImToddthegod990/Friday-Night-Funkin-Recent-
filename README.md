# Friday-Night-Funkin

Friday Night Funkin' (often abbreviated to FNF) is an open-source[2] donationware rhythm game first released in 2020 for a game jam.[3] The game was developed by a team of four Newgrounds users, Cameron "Ninjamuffin99" Taylor, David "PhantomArcade" Brown, Isaac "kawaisprite" Garcia, and evilsk8r. The game shares some gameplay features with Dance Dance Revolution and PaRappa the Rapper and borrows aesthetic influences from Flash games.[4] The game has been credited with driving users back to Newgrounds, a site whose popularity peaked in the early 2000s.

The game includes a roster generally comprising characters from external media on the Newgrounds site.

The game revolves around the player character, Boyfriend, who must defeat a variety of characters in singing and rapping contests in order to date his love interest, Girlfriend. Gameplay revolves around mimicking the opponent's notes with timed inputs while avoiding running out of health for the duration of the song.[5][6]

The game was initially created for the Ludum Dare 47 game jam in October 2020.[7] A full version backed on Kickstarter titled Friday Night Funkin': The Full Ass Game is planned for release in early 2022.[8]

- Development

Ninjamuffin99 assembled a small team of Newgrounds creators to develop an initial Friday Night Funkin' prototype as a submission to Ludum Dare 47 in October 2020, which contained only a handful of music tracks and lacked menus. Despite its rudimentary design, the prototype received unexpected success, leading to many requests for a full game. In response, Ninjamuffin99 claimed to have plans to expand the game.[7]

Ninjamuffin99 would later update this demo on November 1, 2020, which added several additional menus and options as well as "Week 2", an additional fight. Interest in the game grew, with it quickly growing in notoriety on Newgrounds as it had received significant attention via platforms such as YouTube, Twitter, TikTok, and Twitch. Its soundtrack by composer Kawai Sprite has been made available for free on Bandcamp and Spotify.[9]

In February 2021, Ninjamuffin99 requested Nintendo to allow his game to be ported on the Nintendo Switch. However, his request was rejected, which he believed was because the game was incomplete.[10]

Week 7 was released as a timed exclusive on Newgrounds.[11] Due to the increase in traffic this caused to Newgrounds, the site crashed and was unavailable for several days. The game ended its weekly update following Week 7, with the developers instead focusing on working on the full game, titled Friday Night Funkin': The Full Ass Game.[12]
